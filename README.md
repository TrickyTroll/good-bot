# `good-bot` ðŸ¤–

Automating the recording of documentation videos.

`good-bot` automates the process of recording documentation for your
projects. It even provides voice-over using
[Google TTS](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/).

## Quickstart

> How to quickly get started with `good-bot`.

The easiest way to install `good-bot` is to pull the Docker
[image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trickytroll/good-bot). The
image has every tool required by the program pre-installed.
The only requirement is that you have a working 
Docker(https://www.docker.com) installation.

Once you have pulled the image, you can try good bot using
the following command.

```shell
docker run -it trickytroll/good-bot:latest
```

> **Note:** You can also just run the previous command and
> the image will be pulled automatically.

Every `good-bot` command also requires a configuration file.
Since those files reside on your computer, you will need to
pass them to the container so that the program can read
them.

Passing file to a container is quite simple using 
[`volumes`](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). In short
you will need to add the following flag and argument to the
previous `docker run` command.

```shell
--volume $PWD:/project
```

The complete command looks like this:

```shell
docker run -it --volume $PWD:/project trickytroll/good-bot:latest
```

This will bind your current working directory to the container's
`/project` directory.

You can now use `good-bot`'s command line interface to record
a video.

If you are not feeling like writing a script for now but still
want to see what `good-bot` is capable of, you can use the
[no audio](./examples/basics/no-audio.yaml) example.

## Install

> Installing the most recent version of `good-bot` locally.

`good-bot` is a containerized application. To use the app, you must have
a working [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installation.

To build the container, simply run `docker build -t [SOME TAG] .` in the
same directory as the `Dockerfile`. `[SOME TAG]` is to be replaced by
a name of your choosing.

### Adding voice-over

If you want to use `Google TTS`, you will need an API key for the service.
To get your code, you can follow the [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-protocol)
provided by Google.

Once you have activated the API, you'll be able to download a `.json` file that
contains your key. As mentionned in the Google TTS documentation, you will also
need to bind the path to your `.json` file to the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
variable. This is where instructions for `goodbot` differ from the ones in Google's
documentation.

When `goodbot` runs, it will look for the value of the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Since your host's
environment variables are not sent to the container by default, you will
need to pass the `.json` credentials file to the container. The environment
variable needs to be set for the container, not just the host.

To copy your private key to the container, you can add the following flag
when running the container:

```shell
-v [PATH/TO/FILE]:/.env
```

Where `[PATH/TO/FILE]` needs to be replaced by the path towards the directory
that contains your key on your host's filesystem. This mounts the previously
mentionned directory in your container under the path `/.env`.

Now that your API key is accessible from container, you can set the
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable using the following command:

```bash
--env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/.env/[KEY-NAME].json
```

Where `KEY-NAME` needs to be replaced by the name of the `.json` file
previously downloaded.

#### Voice-over summary

To use voice-over, you will need to activate the Google Text to Speech
API for your Google Cloud account. You will also need an API key, which
can be downloaded as a `.json` file.

Once you have your key on your host computer, you can share the key to
the container and enable it by adding the following flags to the `docker run`
command (see [Recording your video](#recording-your-video)).

```bash
-v [PATH/TO/FILE]:/.env --env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/.env/[KEY-NAME].json
```

`[PATH/TO/FILE]` and `[KEY-NAME]` must be replaced by your own values.

### Creating a project

Once you have written your configuration file, you can create your project
using `good-bot`'s `setup` command.

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/project -t [SOME TAG] setup [CONFIG NAME]
```

Where

- `[SOME TAG]` is the tag previously chosen.
- `[CONFIG NAME]` is the name of the configuration file.

> Keep in mind that this command mounts the current working directory
> in the container. If your configuration file is not under your
> current working directory, the previous command won't work.

### Recording your video

If you have a project directory, you can record your clips using

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD:/project -t [SOME TAG] record [PROJECT NAME]
```

Where

- `[SOME TAG]` is the tag previously chosen.
- `[PROJECT NAME]` is the name of the project file.

> **Note**: This is where you need to include the `--env`
> and `-v` flags mentionned [earlier](#adding-voice-over).
